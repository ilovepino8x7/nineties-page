# Nineties Website
I built this website based on my stereotype of what websites in the (late!) nineties looked like for <a href="https://olympics.hackclub.com" target="_blank">HackClub's Boba Olympics</a> 'Most Nineties' Category.
It has one eye-hurting page and music if you click the background - a midi version of Angels by Robbie Williams
